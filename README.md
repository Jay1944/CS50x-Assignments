# CS50x-Assignments
CS50 PROBLEM SETS AND LAB QUESTIONS

This repository contains my work for the CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science course by Harvard University. I have completed various assignments ranging from basic programming in C to advanced algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

## Assignments

### PSET 1: Hello
- **Description**: In this assignment, I learned how to write a simple program in C that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
- **Technologies**: C programming.
- **Link**: [PSET1-Hello](./PSET1-Hello/)

### PSET 2: Arrays
- **Description**: In PSET 2, I worked with arrays and learned how to manipulate data in C. The assignment involved coding a program to calculate change in coins.
- **Technologies**: C programming, arrays.
- **Link**: [PSET2-Arrays](./PSET2-Arrays/)

## Final Project
- **Description**: The final project is a [brief description of your final project].
- **Technologies Used**: C, Python, [Any other tools].

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- Python
- Algorithms
- Git
- Command Line

## How to Use
- To run the PSET1 program, compile it using:
make hello
./hello
